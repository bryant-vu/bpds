	- (Wine hypothesis: which factor is the greatest contributor to wine prices)
	
Dataset
	- Acquire data
	- Clean data
	- Explore, analyze, ID patterns, visuals -- use statistics 

Modeling	
	- Choose ds model to solve problem (explain)

Test Case
	- Apply solution to small scale data
	- Run analyses
	- Provide visuals
	- Comparative analysis to overall dataset w stats from previous

Full Model
	- Apply to entire dataset (compare to test case, agree/disagree, etc)
	- Visuals
	- Inferences from full model vs test case

Conclusions
